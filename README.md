Website Live Link - https://travelo-db936.web.app/

My Website is about Travel Company. It mainly focuses on helping tourists to go to beautiful locations by booking website's services!

This was a really big project for me. Its completely full-stacked! I have designed this website with utmost care!

I will break down my full website designing in 6 breakpoints.

Client Side- 

UI Designing
-I have gotten my idea of the website from colorlib. I researched a lot of website to go perfectly with my taste.
-I have divide my website in 6 pages excluding signin.
-Each page has different contents.
-The home page has different type of sections.
-I have used Bootstarp cdn and react bootstrap to design the responsiveness of the UI.
-Mostly used 2 colors throughout the website.
-Every page has header and footer.
-I have created a not found page too in case pages are not available.

Structure
-I have divided the websites in to various components.
-The src file have hooks, context and components in different folder.
-The component folder has A main folder call pages. Where i have kept all of the Navs and their selective pages individually.
-The Home folder has various child components on it!
-Also i placed the privateroute folder in the signin component.

Router
-I have implemented react router dom.
-This helps us to walk thorugh between different pages without reloadin.
-I have placed the routes on app.js ! and wrapped them around Authcontext. Every route has there different loctions.
-I have implemented dynamic route on the service section of the home page to redirect us to selected data's detailed information.

Firebase Authentication
-I have created a firebase project and hosted my files on it as an web app.
-I have implemented only one authorization for my sign in which is Google Sign In.
-The user information will be stored on my firebase project.
-The header shows the users name everytime the user signs in.

Backend Side-

Data
-I have used node.js and express.js for the backend. And Connected My Backend server with MongoDB!
-I have Created a project on mongodb and conneted it with my Backend using ID and Password.
-I have done get, post and delete operation on the backend side.
-This operations are connected with my client side.
-At last I have hosted my website with Heroku. and used heroku live server link for my client side.

Functionality

-The Website is mainly full stacked!
-When users are not logged in they cant use the functionality as the navbar will only show 3 routes!
-But once the user log is it will show 3 more routes also users can book any of the services from the website.
-User can cancel the services they booked or placed.
-User can also see which users have logged in and purchased which service on the Manage Order option. 
-User can even add new services to the website. This is an admin fuctionaliy which we might learn later.
-This website is responsive for both desktop and mobile.


This project was really important part to me! I really enjoyed doing it!
